====================================================================
Define header script which should be the preface of all test cases.
This is non-standard in the sense that it is not a test case but
rather used to configure global setup for all test cases.  Ulimately,
it is prepended to every subprocess script, and the trailer is
appended to it.  Thus the functions and setup defined here are
available to and applicable to all tests.  The test case names
`header` and `trailer` are reserved for this purpose amd should
not be used for ordinary tests.

====================================================================
name: header
$ set -eu -o pipefail
$
$ umask 0027
$
$ # Add file and directory lister functions which omit output likely
$ # to vary between different systems,  particularly uid and gid.
$
$ show_file () {
$     local perms=$(ls -l "$1" | cut -d' ' -f1)
$     local owner=$(ls -l "$1" | cut -d' ' -f3)
$     local group=$(ls -l "$1" | cut -d' ' -f4)
$     echo $perms $owner $group $1
$ }
$
$ show_dir () {
$     local perms=$(ls -ld "$1" | cut -d' ' -f1)
$     local owner=$(ls -ld "$1" | cut -d' ' -f3)
$     local group=$(ls -ld "$1" | cut -d' ' -f4)
$     echo $perms $owner $group $1
$ }
$
$ show_id() {
$     echo "uid=$(id -n -u) gid=$(id -n -g)"
$ }

====================================================================
Define trailer script which should be appended to every test
script and run for every succesful case.  Like header,  it is
a pseudo-test-case which is used to construct every other
normal test case.

name: trailer
$ exit 0    # implied but make explicit

Nothing much here currently

====================================================================
Do some self tests:

You can match the expected exit code exactly:

name: self-test valid exit_code
$ exit 1
exit_code: 1

You can abstract the exit_code to "fail" or "ok".

name: self-test invalid exit_code 2
$ exit 2
exit_code: fail

name: self-test valid exit_code
$ true
exit_code: 0

name: self-test valid exit_code
$ true
exit_code: ok

Text immediately following the last $ in a block of commands
is used to define standard output.  The first whitespace-only (blank)
line terminates expected standard output:

name: self-test valid stdout
$ echo "hello world"
hello world

It's possible just to ignore standard output by setting the exit
code to expect success but not match output:

name: self-test valid exit_code ignore
$ echo "hello world"
exit_code: ignore_stdout

stderr follows stdout and must be immediately preceded by !!. In
the case below,  stdout,  which is not expected at all,  is omitted:

name: self-test valid stderr
$ echo "goodbye world" 1>&2
$ exit 1
!!
goodbye world

When the name of a case contains the string <invert-check> the outcome
of the test is reversed as seen below.   If the check results would normally
pass,  the test fails.  If the check results would normally fail, then
the test passes.

name: self-test valid stdout  <invert-check>
$ echo "hello world"
hell wrld

name: self-test valid stderr  <invert-check>
$ echo "goodbye world" 1>&2
exit_code: 0
!!
good world

name: self-test valid stderr  <invert-check>
$ echo "goodbye world" 1>&2
$ true
exit_code: 0
there was a lot to say
!!
goodbye world
